We are aiming high and have an open brief to define what works best for our audience. We want to stay lean and move quickly to build, test and learn as we go, so your contribution will make a difference from day one. We want everyone to feel responsible for our collective success.

You’ll have the opportunity to engage with engineers working on other BBC apps and services, tapping into the wealth of knowledge and experience of an organisation already serving a vast global audience. Learning is an important part of the role, and you’ll have access to BBC Academy training programmes, the opportunity to attend technology conferences, and use other resources to progress as an engineer.

We are looking for:

- **executive product manager (datalab):** we are looking for a product leader to develop data products and services that support the ambitions of multiple pan-BBC technical and editorial strategies. You’ll need to partner with other BBC teams teams to solve problems and identify opportunities coming from data, automation and machine learning. The perfect candidate would have experience of building high performing teams with a focus on data (rather than audience facing) products.
- **lead data engineer (machine learning):** the Datalab needs an inspiring engineering lead who has deep technical knowledge and experience (or a willingness) to take on the people management side of things. This role will be responsible for a talented team of up to ten engineers working on a stack that includes Google Cloud Platform, Python and Kubernetes with a commitment to micro-services and infrastructure as code.
- **senior project manager agile:** we need an experienced agile practitioner to help the Datalab team fulfil their potential. You will know which agile or lean tools and techniques to use according to the context without being slavish to any particular approach. The right candidate will know that a happy team will produce the most amazing work, they will be skilled at building trust, managing team dynamics and motivating people.
- **data scientist or senior data scientist:** we need someone to help us develop new recommendation engines that work with text, audio and video. You will also help us ‘enrich’ content by using machine learning to extract what the content is about. You know key machine learning algorithms well and are comfortable in putting these in use in production systems that serve millions of customers. Cloud (GCP), containers, CI/CD pipelines and Python are things that excite you.
- **data engineer or senior data engineer:** you will help us create a data and machine learning environment that can scale to millions of users. You will help integrate new data sources and ensure that the code we write is robust and scalable. You have a keen interest in machine learning (but not necessarily previous experience). You are excited and knowledgeable about a tech stack that includes Google Cloud Platform, Python and Kubernetes with a commitment to micro-services and infrastructure as code.
- **data scientist or senior data scientist with natural language understanding:** you’ll be helping the Datalab support the BBC Voice and AI team. This means that you will help us take advantage of new voice interfaces by turning text into audience intent. This intent can then be used to serve audience with the most relevant content given their context and interest. You are experienced in natural language modelling and topic extraction. If you have worked on speech to text that would be a real bonus. Cloud (GCP), containers, CI/CD pipelines and Python are things that excite you.
