# Welcome to the BBC data journey!

We are excited that you are interested in helping us on our data journey and are looking forward to getting to know you better.

This exercise gives you the opportunity to show us your technical skills. We have kept the questions quite broad on purpose so that you can really showcase your special area of expertise. 

Please make sure that you add any comments and references that help us read the code.

## 1) Preparing the data:
Please choose a dataset that suits your skill set and show us what you would do to get that dataset ready to be ingested into a machine-learning algorithm.
We can suggest a few possible datasets to make this a little bit easier, but you may choose a different, comparable, dataset if you prefer:
-	[MovieLens dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) that gives ratings and tags applied to a number of movies by a large number of viewers
-	[Labeled faces in the wild](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/) provides images of celebrities with associated name tags
-	[BBC Datasets](http://mlg.ucd.ie/datasets/bbc.html) provides a small number of documents and labels from BBC news and BBC sports
- [Amazon Fine Food Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/qwikfix/amazon-recommendation-dataset/data) provides reviews of fine foods from Amazon

## 2) Machine learning:
Please build us a predictive model based on the ingested data. Why did you pick the specific technique(s) you used? What parameters matter in this case? What assumptions does the model make about the data that it is being trained on?

## 3) Evaluation:
Provide an evaluation of how your model performed â€“ did it perform well? 

We recommend you use something like Jupyter notebooks to ensure that we can see the output of your code as well as the code. You are free to use any programming language, technologies or libraries that you want.

Once you have completed all tasks, please upload the relevant files to https://www.dropbox.com/request/iu2Edq1GwXqR8bR4ZjjZ
